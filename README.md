# DICOM Viewer - Simple medical image processing

The program loads volumes in 512x512 resolution and then presents them as a bitmap. You can freely navigate through the images. 
There are 3 different views: axial, sagitall and coronal.

Using the checkboxes in the right panel, there are 4 preview options:
* Pixel average
* First Hit
* Max
* Region Growing Segmentation

---

The Region Growing works as follows:

1. select an area in the Axial view
2. click somewhere to mark the starting point
3. click the Region Growing checkbox

---

There is also histogram under axial view.
Also you can zoom-in any area on axial view.
